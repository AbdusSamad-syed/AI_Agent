##AI Scheduling Agent

**Project Overview:**
Build a medical appointment scheduling AI agent that automates patient booking,
reduces no-shows, and streamlines clinic operations. This mirrors real-world challenges in
healthcare technology.

**Conclusion: **
The AI Scheduling Agent implements a complete appointment workflow using LangChain with modular tools, Gradio interface, and file-based data handling. It demonstrates seamless integration of LLM intelligence with practical operational tasks, providing a functional, testable prototype suitable for healthcare scheduling.
